# FFICM/FRCA Viva Station: Obstetrics

**Topic:** Placenta Praevia & Obstetric Haemorrhage
**Time:** 10 Minutes
**Reference:** Based on `full_soe_master_reference_v3.md` - Obstetrics [OB_IK_04]

## 1. Opening Clinical Stem
> "You are the anaesthetist on call for the labour ward. You are asked to see a 34-year-old multigravida (G3 P2) at 36 weeks gestation. She has been admitted with a small antepartum bleed. The obstetrician tells you she has a 'Major Placenta Praevia' and they are planning a Category 4 (Elective) Caesarean section for tomorrow morning."

**Lead-in:** "How would you prepare this patient for surgery?"

---

## 2. Assessment Domain (Clinical Management)
*The candidate should demonstrate a structured preoperative assessment and planning for potential massive haemorrhage.*

**Key Points Required:**
-   **History & Assessment:** Review previous obstetric history (previous C-sections increase risk of Placenta Accreta Spectrum). Assessing current haemodynamic stability and airway (Mallampati, etc.).
-   **Investigations:** Check Haemoglobin, platelets, coagulation screen. Review Ultrasound/MRI for signs of invasion (Accreta/Increta/Percreta).
-   **Preparation (The "4 Ps"):**
    -   *Patient:* Consent (General Anaesthesia vs Regional, high risk of conversion to GA, hysterectomy risk), 2x large bore IV access.
    -   *Products:* Cross-match (4-6 units minimum), cell salvage availability.
    -   *Place:* Main theatre vs Obstetric theatre (need for Interventional Radiology?).
    -   *People:* Senior Anaesthetist, Senior Obstetrician, Haematologist, Cell Salvage tech, potentially Interventional Radiologist (for balloon occlusion).

**Specific Question:** "The patient asks if she can be awake for the delivery. What is your advice?"
-   **Answer:** Regional anaesthesia (CSE/Spinal) is preferred for standard placenta praevia (safer, less blood loss, mother sees baby). However, if *Accreta* is suspected or actively bleeding, GA is often safer/required.

**Critical Fail (Red Flag):**
-   Failing to anticipate massive haemorrhage/Placenta Accreta.
-   Failing to cross-match blood.

## 3. Science Base (Anatomy & Positioning)
**Transition:** "You proceed with a spinal anaesthetic. The surgery is more complex than anticipated and takes 3 hours. You notice the patient's left arm has been tucked awkwardly at her side."

**Q1: Positioning & Nerve Injury ([AN_IK_07])**
-   "What are the specific risks of nerve injury associated with the lithotomy or supine position in obstetric patients?"
    -   *Common Peroneal Nerve:* Compression against lithotomy stirrups (foot drop).
    -   *Femoral Nerve:* Excessive hip flexion/abduction or compression by retractors.
    -   *Lateral Cutaneous Nerve of Thigh:* Compression at inguinal ligament.

**Q2: Upper Limb Injuries**
-   "If the arm is abducted >90 degrees or hangs off the bed, which structure is at risk?"
    -   *Brachial Plexus:* Stretching complications.
    -   *Ulnar Nerve:* Compression at the elbow (condylar groove) if not padded or supinated.

**Q3: Physiological Consequences of Position**
-   "Why do we use a 'wedge' or table tilt in this patient?"
    -   **Aortocaval Compression:** The gravid uterus compresses the IVC (reducing preload/CO) and Aorta (reducing uteroplacental flow).
    -   **Effect:** Supine Hypotensive Syndrome.
    -   **Management:** Left lateral displacement (15-degree tilt).

## 4. Management of Complications
**Transition:** "During the surgery, the obstetrician reports difficult haemostasis and 'bogginess' of the lower segment. The suction canisters are filling rapidly. The BP drops to 70/40."

**Lead-in:** "Manage this evolving situation."

**Key Points:**
-   **Communication:** Declare Major Haemorrhage Protocol (2222).
-   **Resuscitation:** 1:1:1 ratio (RBC:FFP:Plt). Tranexamic Acid (1g). Fibrinogen (Cryoprecipitate).
-   **Pharmacological:** Uterotonics chain: Oxytocin (Syntocinon) -> Ergometrine (if no hypertension) -> Carboprost -> Misoprostol.
-   **Surgical:** B-Lynch suture, intrauterine balloon, aortic compression, hysterectomy.

**Differentiation (Merit):**
-   Discussion of **Cell Salvage** in obstetrics (safe with leukocyte depletion filter, importance of washing amniotic fluid).
-   Discussion of **ROTEM/TEG** guided transfusion.
