Title: RCoA Final SOE: Short Case Pass Example
Topic: Subarachnoid Haemorrhage (Coiling)
Generated on: February 18, 2026

**Examiner:** This is your next clinical short case. You are the duty anaesthetist in a neurosurgical centre. You are asked to anaesthetise a 45-year-old female who has presented with a Grade 1 subarachnoid haemorrhage for urgent coiling of an anterior communicating artery aneurysm. Talk me through your preoperative assessment.

**Candidate:** So, er, I would start by taking a focused history and examination. I'm interested in the timeline of events—when the headache started—and her current neurological status. You said she's Grade 1, so I assume she's alert and orientated with a GCS of 15?

**Examiner:** Yes, GCS 15, severe headache, photophobia.

**Candidate:** Okay. So, in terms of my assessment, I'd want to know about her comorbidities, particularly hypertension or any connective tissue disorders associated with aneurysms. I'd specifically ask about her medications, checking for anticoagulants or antiplatelets. Um, airway assessment is crucial, obviously, although if she's GCS 15 it's likely manageable, but I'd check mouth opening and neck movement, bearing in mind she might have some meningism which could make neck flexion painful or limited.

**Examiner:** Her airway looks straightforward. She has a history of hypertension controlled on Ramipril. What investigations would you want to review?

**Candidate:** I'd want to see her recent bloods—FBC, U&Es to check electrolytes, especially sodium as hyponatraemia is common in SAH, and a clotting screen. I'd also want to review her CT angiogram images to understand the aneurysm anatomy, though that's more for the interventional radiologist, but it's good to know. And a baseline ECG.

**Examiner:** Okay, her sodium is 138, ECG shows sinus rhythm. How would you induce anaesthesia for this patient?

**Candidate:** The key principle here is maintaining haemodynamic stability to prevent aneurysm rupture before it's secured. So, I need to avoid hypertension during induction. I'd initiate full standard monitoring, including invasive blood pressure monitoring—an arterial line—ideally placed awake if she tolerates it, or certainly before induction if I can use local anaesthetic liberally.

**Examiner:** She's very anxious and refuses an awake arterial line.

**Candidate:** In that case, I'd site it immediately after induction, but I'd be very careful with my drug titration. I'd probably use a combination of Propofol and Remifentanil. Remifentanil is excellent for blunting the sympathetic response to laryngoscopy. I'd induce with a generous dose of Fentanyl or start the Remi infusion, then Propofol, and a non-depolarising muscle relaxant like Rocuronium. I'd wait for full paralysis before intubating to ensure a smooth, cough-free intubation.

**Examiner:** Fine. You're in the interventional suite now. What are your goals for maintenance and what specific problems might you encounter during the procedure?

**Candidate:** So, maintenance I'd usually continue with TIVA—Propofol and Remifentanil—because it allows for rapid wake-up and neurological assessment post-procedure. It also helps reduce ICP. My goals are strict blood pressure control—keeping systolic probably below 140 or as agreed with the radiologist until the coil is in—and maintaining normocapnia. Temperature control is also important.

**Examiner:** And problems?

**Candidate:** The big disaster is intra-procedural rupture. If that happens, I need to be ready to lower the MAP immediately to reduce bleeding, possibly with Protamine if they've given Heparin, and ensuring the airway is secure. The other issue is thromboembolism, as they'll likely heparinise the patient once the coil is deployed.

**Examiner:** Good. The procedure goes well, the aneurysm is coiled. The radiologist is happy. How will you manage her emergence and recovery?

**Candidate:** I'd want a smooth emergence to avoid coughing or straining, which would spike her intracranial pressure. So, I'd keep the Remifentanil running until the very end, or swap to a bolus of Fentanyl or Alfentanil for transition. I'd ensure she's fully reversed from the neuromuscular block. I'd use anti-emetics prophylactically because vomiting is bad for ICP. Once she's obeying commands and breathing adequately, I'd extubate.

**Examiner:** Where should she go post-operatively?

**Candidate:** She needs a high-dependency environment, a Neuro-HDU or ICU, for close neurological monitoring—hourly GCS checks and BP control. We need to watch for vasospasm in the coming days, but immediately, it's about detecting any re-bleeding or hydrocephalus.

**Examiner:** Thank you.

**Score: 2 (Pass)**
The candidate demonstrated a safe, structured approach. They correctly identified the critical importance of blood pressure control during induction to prevent aneurysm rupture (transmural pressure gradient). They showed good knowledge of TIVA for neuroradiology and the rationale for smooth emergence. Their management of the "anxious patient" refusal for the arterial line was pragmatic and safe.
