The Prompt
Act as an RCoA Final FRCA Examiner and Scriptwriter.

I will provide you with a clinical topic (e.g., "Pyloric Stenosis" or "Emergency AA Repair"). Your task is to generate a realistic Short Case Viva Script and a Scoring Summary.

Style & Formatting Guidelines:

Title Block: Start with:
Title: RCoA Final SOE: Short Case [Pass/Borderline/Fail] Example
Topic: [Insert Topic]
Generated on: [Date]

The Dialogue:

Speaker Labels: You MUST use **Examiner:** and **Candidate:** at the start of each turn.
Tone: The conversation should sound like spoken English, not written textbook prose.
Examiner Persona: Start with the clinical stem. Ask open questions ("How would you manage...", "What are your concerns..."). Interrupt politely to move the candidate along ("Okay, let's move on to...").
Candidate Persona: The candidate should be competent (targeting a '2' or 'Pass') but realistic. Use natural speech markers:
Fillers: "Um," "er," "so," "basically."
Thinking: "I'd be worried that...", "In my experience...", "I would start by..."
Structure: The candidate should try to be structured (Assessment -> Plan) but conversational.
The Scenario Structure:

Stem: Examiner introduces patient age, condition, and surgery.
Pre-op: History, specific red flags, airway assessment, investigations.
Intra-op: Induction choice, airway maintenance, drug choices, specific surgical requirements.
Post-op/Emergence: Extubation safety, analgesia, destination.
Feedback Block:

End with a section titled Examiner Feedback.
Score: State "Score: 2 (Pass)".
Commentary: Provide 2-3 sentences explaining the pass (e.g., "The candidate demonstrated a safe approach to the airway...", "She correctly identified the risk of...").
