# FFICM/FRCA Viva Station: Neuroanaesthesia (Trauma)

**Topic:** Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) & Multitrauma
**Time:** 10 Minutes
**Reference:** Based on `soe_master_reference.md` - Neuroanaesthesia Topic 1

## 1. Opening Clinical Stem
> "You are the anaesthetist on call. A 25-year-old male is brought to ED by ambulance following a high-speed road traffic accident. He is intubated at the scene. His current GCS is 3 (E1, V1, M1). Pupils are unequal (Left > Right) and sluggish. BP is 90/50, HR 110. He has a suspect pelvic fracture."

**Lead-in:** "Talk me through your immediate management priorities in the Emergency Department."

## 2. Assessment Domain (Clinical Management)
*The candidate should demonstrate a structured ABC approach.*

**Key Points Required:**
-   **Airway:** Verify tube position (capnography), cervical spine immobilisation (Triple immobilisation/blocks).
-   **Breathing:** Ventilation targets. **Prompt:** "What are your specific PaCO2 targets here?" -> Normocapnia (4.5–5.0 kPa). Avoid preventative hyperventilation (risk of ischaemia).
-   **Circulation:** Fluid resuscitation. **Prompt:** "He is hypotensive. Why is this critical to fix?" -> Maintain CPP.
-   **Disability:** Pupillary assessment, sedation management.
-   **Exposure:** Temperature control.

**Critical Fail (Red Flag):**
-   Allowing hypotension (SBP < 100 mmHg) to persist without vasopressors/fluids (Doubles mortality).
-   Clearing C-spine clinically in a comatose patient.

## 3. Science Base (Physiology & Pharm)
**Transition:** "You decide to transfer him to CT. The CT shows a large acute subdural haematoma with midline shift."

**Q1: Intracranial Pressure Physiology**
-   "Explain the Monro-Kellie Doctrine." (Fixed volume skull = Brain + Blood + CSF).
-   "How does this relate to his unreactive pupil?" (Uncal herniation compressing CN III).

**Q2: Pharmacology**
-   "You need to sedate him for transfer to the neurosurgical centre. What drugs will you use and why?"
    -   *Propofol:* Reduces CMRO2 and CBF (Coupled). Good for ICP, but causes hypotension.
    -   *Ketamine:* (Controversial but acceptable if BP supported).
    -   *Mannitol/Hypertonic Saline:* Mechanism of action (Osmotherapy).
-   **Differentiation (Merit):** "What does the recent evidence say about the use of prophylactic decompressive craniectomy?" (Ref: RESCUE-ICP trial discussion).

## 4. Professional Capabilities (Stage 2)
**Transition:** "The Neurosurgical registrar at the tertiary centre accepts the patient but says they have no ICU beds and asks you to keep the patient in your local non-neuro ICU overnight."

**Q3: Leadership & Safety**
-   "How do you manage this specific request?"
    -   This is a time-critical surgical emergency (Subdural).
    -   Staying locally is **unsafe** (delay to decompression).
-   **Behaviour (Team-A):** Assertive communication. Escalation to consultants used for leverage.
-   **Safety (Safety-I):** Risk of transfer vs Risk of staying.
-   **Key Guideline:** "AAGBI Safe Transfer of the Brain Injured Patient" -> Time critical lesions must move.

## 5. Marking Key

| Domain | Pass Criteria | Merit Criteria |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Knowledge** | Knows MAP targets >80mmHg. Knows PaCO2 targets. | Discusses flow-metabolism coupling in depth. |
| **Clinical** | Corrects hypotension immediately. Clear transfer checklist. | Anticipates specific complications of pelvic fx (blood loss). |
| **Safety** | Refuses unsafe delay in transfer. | Cites AAGBI/NICE guidelines specifically. |

**Outcome:** [ Pass / Fail / Borderline ]
