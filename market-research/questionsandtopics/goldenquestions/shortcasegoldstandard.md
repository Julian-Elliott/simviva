# Parkinsons Disease Short Case

## Clinical Questions

Examiner: You’re asked to anaesthetise a patient with Parkinson’s disease for dental extractions. What is Parkinson’s disease—pathophysiology, presentation and course?

Candidate: Parkinson’s disease is a common, progressive neurodegenerative disorder, and it’s best thought of as a multi-system neurological condition rather than purely an extrapyramidal movement disorder. Pathophysiologically it’s due to loss of dopaminergic neurones in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra, which leads to reduced dopaminergic input and the classical motor syndrome. There’s quite a large neuronal reserve, so symptoms often don’t become apparent until around sixty to eighty percent of dopaminergic neurones have degenerated. Age is the biggest risk factor, so most patients are older, and many live with the condition for decades.

Clinically, I’d describe features under motor and non-motor, and early versus later. The primary motor features are bradykinesia, rigidity, and a resting tremor that’s typically asymmetrical. Non-motor symptoms can precede diagnosis and include fatigue, depression or anxiety, sleep disturbance, and constipation. As the disease progresses, later motor features include gait change—stooped posture, shuffling gait with small steps and loss of arm swing—plus dysphagia, hypophonia, reduced facial expression, small handwriting, and postural instability with falls. Neuropsychiatric issues become more prominent with time, with slowed cognitive speed, inattention and poor problem solving, and some patients go on to develop dementia later in the disease course. Autonomic dysfunction is also important—postural hypotension, drooling from impaired swallowing, and urinary and sexual dysfunction.

From an anaesthetic perspective, Parkinson’s is associated with increased perioperative morbidity and mortality—particularly aspiration pneumonia, falls, venous thromboembolism, respiratory failure—and postoperative delirium is common and can be delayed in onset.

Examiner: How do you approach preoperative assessment and optimisation in this patient?

Candidate: My aims are to quantify disease severity and functional reserve, identify system complications that will affect anaesthesia, and—crucially—plan perioperative dopaminergic therapy so we maintain central dopamine receptor activation.

So, in assessment I’d focus on airway, respiratory, cardiovascular autonomic function, cognition, and swallowing. Airway-wise, there may be upper airway dysfunction from laryngeal and pharyngeal muscle involvement—so retained secretions and aspiration risk—and a fixed flexion deformity of the neck which can make laryngoscopy and positioning difficult. Respiratory-wise, they can have a restrictive pattern from rigidity and bradykinesia of respiratory muscles, and obstructive sleep apnoea is common, so I assess cough strength, secretion clearance and baseline respiratory function. Cardiovascularly, I’m looking particularly for orthostatic hypotension and arrhythmias; hypotension can be due to the disease itself and also the medication. Neurologically, I want baseline cognition and any hallucinations or previous delirium, because they’re at higher risk postoperatively. Gastrointestinally, dysphagia is key because it drives aspiration risk and malnutrition; reflux and delayed gastric emptying are more prevalent and affect aspiration risk and absorption of oral medications. I’d also consider urological issues because urinary dysfunction and postoperative UTI are more likely.

In optimisation, for elective surgery I’d involve the Parkinson’s team early and coordinate with Parkinson’s nurse specialists—particularly to plan medication timing and delirium prevention strategies. I’d warn the patient that symptom control may be less than optimal around surgery despite best efforts. And I’d plan postoperative destination—if they have poor swallow or cough, sleep apnoea, or significant autonomic dysfunction, I’d have a low threshold for higher dependency or critical care.

Examiner: Talk me through perioperative management of Parkinson’s medication.

Candidate: The guiding principle is continuous central dopamine receptor activation. In practice, the safest approach is usually to continue the patient’s usual regimen as close to normal as possible. I would allow them to take their Parkinson’s medications right up to induction, even within the nil-by-mouth window, with a sip of water. I would also try to make the list predictable—ideally first on the list—so dosing times aren’t missed.

If I anticipate a prolonged procedure or delayed oral intake, I’d plan early for an enteral route—such as dispersible preparations via nasogastric tube where appropriate—because most Parkinson’s medications are only available enterally. If the patient is normally on modified-release formulations, I’d be cautious when switching preparations because bioavailability differs.

If the enteral route is not possible or unreliable—particularly in emergency or abdominal pathology with vomiting, ileus, or poor absorption—then I would move to a bridging strategy. There are two main options: subcutaneous apomorphine infusion, which is potent but difficult to dose and can cause severe hypotension and nausea, so it needs specialist input and careful planning; and transdermal rotigotine, which is generally simpler and very useful in nil-by-mouth patients, though it may not fully cover patients on very high-dose regimens. In frail or acutely unwell patients I’d be cautious with dosing because of neuropsychiatric side effects and delirium risk.

Examiner: What happens if their Parkinson’s medication is omitted?

Candidate: There are immediate functional consequences and potentially life-threatening withdrawal syndromes. Functionally, they may go “off”—with freezing and rigidity—leading to falls, difficulty swallowing, rigidity of respiratory muscles, poor cough and inability to clear secretions, which then increases aspiration and respiratory complications.

More seriously, abrupt withdrawal can precipitate a hyperpyrexia syndrome related to withdrawal of levodopa, which resembles neuroleptic malignant syndrome: severe rigidity, fever, autonomic or cardiovascular instability, and altered mental state ranging from agitation and delirium to coma, and it carries significant mortality if untreated. There is also dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome with anxiety, nausea, depression, pain and orthostatic hypotension. So the key is: don’t abruptly stop; maintain dopamine receptor stimulation and plan any changes.

Examiner: This is dental extractions. What are the specific anaesthetic and airway issues in Parkinson’s disease?

Candidate: For dental extractions my PD-specific concerns are aspiration risk, secretion management, airway mechanics, drug choice, and returning to oral medication quickly.

Aspiration risk is increased because dysphagia is common, cough may be ineffective, and there’s often reflux and delayed gastric emptying, so I’d take a careful swallowing history and consider rapid sequence induction if aspiration risk is high. Secretions can be problematic—drooling is typically due to impaired swallowing rather than excess production—and it can complicate mask ventilation and instrumentation; I’d use a peripherally acting agent like glycopyrrolate if I need to dry secretions.

Airway instrumentation can be challenging if there’s a fixed flexion deformity of the neck. Tremor and dyskinesia can also make monitoring difficult—ECG artefact and difficulty with non-invasive blood pressure—so I’d ensure good electrode contact and consider invasive monitoring only if clinically indicated.

For the anaesthetic technique, I’d prioritise a plan that enables early return of oral intake and minimises nausea and vomiting. If general anaesthesia is required, propofol is often a pragmatic induction agent because it is antiemetic and tends to suppress tremor transiently, although dyskinetic movements can occur. I’d use induction drugs judiciously because hypotension can be pronounced, especially with autonomic dysfunction or dehydration. Neuromuscular blockers can be used safely; I’d aim to avoid residual block because it can mask Parkinsonian symptoms postoperatively. I’m also mindful that reversal with neostigmine can thicken secretions, so I’d use it with caution and consider alternatives depending on the relaxant chosen.


## Science Question - Pharmacology

Examiner: What are the key pharmacology options for Parkinson’s and how they work?

Candidate: There aren’t established disease-modifying therapies, so treatment is symptomatic and often becomes complex over time. The core concept is increasing central dopamine receptor activation.

Levodopa is the most effective for motor symptoms. Dopamine itself doesn’t cross the blood–brain barrier, so we give the precursor levodopa, which crosses and is converted centrally to dopamine. Because peripheral conversion causes side effects like nausea, vomiting and arrhythmias, levodopa is given with a peripherally acting dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor such as carbidopa or benserazide to reduce peripheral dopaminergic effects.

Dopamine agonists act directly at dopamine receptors and can be used as monotherapy earlier or as adjuncts later; examples include pramipexole and ropinirole. For bridging when oral intake isn’t possible, rotigotine transdermal patches and apomorphine subcutaneous therapy are useful options, with the caveat that apomorphine is very emetogenic and can cause hypotension.

There are also enzyme inhibitors used as levodopa-sparing adjuncts: MAO-B inhibitors such as selegiline or rasagiline reduce dopamine breakdown, and COMT inhibitors such as entacapone or tolcapone also reduce breakdown and can prolong levodopa effect. Clinically, patients can develop “on” and “off” periods and dyskinesias, and regimens are often adjusted by dividing doses or adding these adjuncts.

Examiner: What are the anaesthetic implications—particularly contraindicated drugs and safe antiemetics?

Candidate: The big rule is: avoid drugs that antagonise dopamine receptors, because they worsen Parkinsonian symptoms. That includes several antiemetics and antipsychotics used perioperatively—such as metoclopramide, droperidol, and prochlorperazine—and typical antipsychotics like haloperidol.

For antiemesis, I’d use agents without central dopamine antagonism—so a 5-HT3 antagonist like ondansetron is appropriate, and H1 antagonists such as cyclizine are generally acceptable. Domperidone can also be used because it doesn’t readily cross the blood–brain barrier.

I’d also watch for key interactions. If the patient is on an MAO-B inhibitor, meperidine is contraindicated because of the risk of serotonin syndrome. Sympathomimetics can have exaggerated effects in those on MAO-B inhibitors, and epinephrine effects may be exaggerated with COMT inhibitors, so I’d titrate vasopressors carefully. Centrally acting anticholinergics like atropine can precipitate central anticholinergic syndrome, so glycopyrrolate is the safer antimuscarinic. Volatile agents are generally safe, but I’d avoid halothane because it can potentiate levodopa-related arrhythmias—though in modern practice it’s rarely relevant.

Finally, opioid handling: opioids can be used, but large doses may cause rigidity in some cases; and in all cases I’d aim to minimise nausea and ensure reliable restart of dopaminergic medication.

Examiner: Briefly—what are your postoperative priorities?

Candidate: First, confirm how we will deliver Parkinson’s medication before leaving recovery: if the oral route is reliable, restart promptly; if nausea and vomiting make enteral dosing unreliable, supplement with transdermal rotigotine and seek specialist advice early. Second, plan destination—consider higher level care if poor cough or swallow, sleep apnoea, or autonomic instability. Third, analgesia: I’d have a clear plan because tremor and rigidity can limit ability to use PCA devices. And finally delirium: it’s common and often delayed, so I’d prioritise non-pharmacological measures—reorientation and an appropriate environment—and avoid typical antipsychotics like haloperidol; if medication is absolutely necessary, benzodiazepines such as lorazepam are generally safer choices in Parkinson’s.


# Robotic Hyserectomy Short Case

## Clinical Question

Clinical 2 – Robotic hysterectomy following pelvic radiotherapy
Examiner

You are asked to anaesthetise a 62-year-old woman for a robotic hysterectomy following pelvic radiotherapy for endometrial cancer.

What are the anaesthetic implications of robotic surgery?

Candidate

Thank you. I will structure my answer under four areas: positioning, pneumoperitoneum, prolonged operating time, and access and emergency considerations.

Robotic pelvic surgery requires steep Trendelenburg positioning, usually combined with lithotomy. Respiratorily, this causes cephalad displacement of the diaphragm, reducing functional residual capacity and lung compliance, increasing airway and plateau pressures, and promoting atelectasis and ventilation–perfusion mismatch. These effects are more pronounced in obesity or pre-existing respiratory disease.

Cardiovascularly, steep Trendelenburg increases venous return and central venous pressure, and raises intracranial and intraocular pressures. Venous congestion of the head and neck may result in facial, conjunctival and airway oedema. In prolonged cases there is a small but serious risk of ischaemic optic neuropathy.

Lithotomy and head-down positioning increase the risk of peripheral nerve injury, particularly brachial plexus injury if shoulder braces are used, as well as ulnar and common peroneal neuropathies. Compartment syndrome and rhabdomyolysis are rare but recognised complications in prolonged cases.

Pneumoperitoneum increases intra-abdominal pressure and systemic CO₂ absorption.  This reduces lung compliance further and increases airway pressures. CO₂ absorption may lead to hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis, increasing sympathetic tone and potentially causing tachycardia, hypertension and arrhythmias. Minute ventilation must therefore be adjusted to maintain normocapnia.

Cardiovascularly, pneumoperitoneum increases systemic vascular resistance and may initially increase venous return, although at higher insufflation pressures cardiac output may fall. Bradycardia may occur during insufflation due to vagal stimulation.

Although uncommon, recognised complications include subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax and, rarely, CO₂ gas embolism.

Robotic procedures are often prolonged. This increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, particularly in patients with malignancy, as well as hypothermia and corneal abrasion.

Finally, once the robot is docked, access to the airway, chest and arms is restricted. Emergency access requires coordinated undocking. Therefore the airway must be secured with a cuffed endotracheal tube that is well secured, intravenous access must be reliable and extended before docking, and a clear emergency undocking plan must be agreed with the surgical team.

Examiner

How would you assess this patient pre-operatively?

Candidate

I would structure my assessment around the effects of malignancy and its treatment, the consequences of pelvic radiotherapy, and optimisation for robotic surgery.

Regarding malignancy, I would clarify staging and metastatic burden, particularly pulmonary or hepatic involvement, assess functional capacity and frailty, and review nutritional status. If chemotherapy has been given, I would assess for anaemia, thrombocytopenia or neutropenia, as well as renal dysfunction or cardiotoxicity depending on the agents used.

Pelvic radiotherapy causes tissue fibrosis and microvascular damage, leading to poor wound healing and increased infection risk. There may be chronic diarrhoea, malabsorption and electrolyte disturbance, radiation cystitis, enteric fistulae or ureteric strictures. Nutritional compromise and chronic pelvic sepsis may also occur.

Given the physiological stress of steep Trendelenburg and pneumoperitoneum, I would carefully assess cardiovascular and respiratory reserve, review BMI and VTE risk, assess baseline renal function, and perform a full airway assessment.

Examiner

What is your anaesthetic plan?

Candidate

I will describe my plan from induction to postoperative care.

I would use standard monitoring, with consideration of an arterial line if there is significant comorbidity or anticipated haemodynamic instability, both for beat-to-beat blood pressure monitoring and for blood gas analysis to guide ventilation. Core temperature monitoring would be included. I would ensure two reliable intravenous cannulae are sited with extension tubing secured prior to docking.

Induction would be with general anaesthesia and endotracheal intubation using a cuffed tube, which would be carefully secured.

I would ensure deep neuromuscular blockade to optimise surgical exposure and reduce insufflation pressures, using quantitative monitoring and full reversal at the end of surgery.

Maintenance could be with volatile anaesthesia or TIVA. TIVA may reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting and has theoretical oncological benefits, although evidence remains inconclusive.

Ventilation would be volume-controlled with appropriate PEEP, limiting plateau pressures and adjusting minute ventilation to maintain normocapnia in the presence of CO₂ absorption.

Positioning would be carefully checked before docking, with arms tucked neutrally, avoidance of shoulder braces where possible, careful padding of pressure points, neutral head position and eye protection. I would confirm haemodynamic and ventilatory stability in Trendelenburg before docking.

Fluid management would be goal-directed. Excessive fluid may worsen airway oedema, but over-restriction risks hypoperfusion and acute kidney injury. Balanced crystalloids would be preferred, and urine output interpreted cautiously as oliguria may be positional.

Analgesia would be multimodal with paracetamol, NSAIDs if appropriate and titrated opioids. Intrathecal opioid could be considered but is not routinely required.

At the end of surgery, I would assess for facial and airway oedema, elevate the head and consider a cuff leak test if concerned. If significant oedema were present, I would delay extubation. Postoperatively, I would ensure VTE prophylaxis, monitor renal function and observe for airway compromise, with HDU admission if indicated.

## Science Question - Physics & Measurement

Physics Station
Examiner

What is a meta-analysis?

Candidate

A meta-analysis is a statistical technique that combines the quantitative results of multiple studies addressing the same research question in order to generate a pooled estimate of effect. It is usually conducted as part of a systematic review and aims to improve statistical power and precision compared with individual studies.

Examiner

How is a meta-analysis performed?

Candidate

It begins with a clearly defined research question, typically structured using PICO — population, intervention, comparator and outcome — and ideally a predefined protocol.

A comprehensive systematic search of the literature is then undertaken across multiple databases using predefined search terms. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are specified in advance to minimise selection bias. The study selection process is usually summarised using a PRISMA flow diagram.

Relevant data are extracted in a standardised way, including study design, participant characteristics, outcome measures and effect estimates. For dichotomous outcomes, effect sizes may be expressed as risk ratios, odds ratios or hazard ratios. For continuous outcomes, mean differences or standardised mean differences may be used, particularly if different measurement scales are involved.

The methodological quality of the included studies is assessed, often using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomised trials. This examines domains such as selection, performance, detection and reporting bias. The overall certainty of evidence may then be graded using systems such as GRADE. Publication bias may be explored using a funnel plot.

Statistical pooling is performed by weighting individual studies, usually according to inverse variance so that larger, more precise studies contribute more to the overall estimate. A fixed-effect model assumes that all studies estimate a single true effect, whereas a random-effects model assumes that the true effect varies between studies and incorporates between-study variance.

Heterogeneity is assessed using the chi-squared test and quantified using the I² statistic. If heterogeneity is substantial, sensitivity analyses, subgroup analyses or meta-regression may be used to explore possible causes.

The results are commonly displayed in a forest plot.

Examiner

What is heterogeneity and why is it important?

Candidate

Heterogeneity refers to variability between the included studies. It may be clinical, such as differences in patient populations or interventions; methodological, such as differences in study design or quality; or statistical, meaning variation in effect sizes beyond what would be expected by chance.

It is important because significant heterogeneity reduces confidence that the pooled estimate reflects a single meaningful treatment effect. The I² statistic quantifies the proportion of variability due to heterogeneity rather than chance, with values above around 50 percent suggesting moderate heterogeneity. High heterogeneity may make a random-effects model more appropriate and requires cautious interpretation of the pooled result.

Examiner

Please interpret this forest plot.

Candidate

In a forest plot, each horizontal line represents an individual study. The square represents the study’s point estimate, and its size reflects the weighting assigned to that study in the meta-analysis. The horizontal line through the square represents the confidence interval, usually 95 percent.

The vertical line represents the line of no effect. For ratios such as risk ratio or odds ratio this is one, and for mean difference it is zero. If a study’s confidence interval crosses this line, it is not statistically significant at the 5 percent level.

At the bottom of the plot, the diamond represents the pooled estimate. The centre of the diamond indicates the combined effect size, and the width represents its confidence interval. If the diamond does not cross the line of no effect, the overall result is statistically significant.

In interpreting the plot, I would comment on the direction of effect and which intervention is favoured, the magnitude and precision of the pooled estimate, the degree of heterogeneity shown, and whether a fixed-effect or random-effects model has been used. I would also distinguish between statistical significance and clinical significance when considering the implications of the findings.

# Awake Craniotomy Short Case

## Clinical Question

Examiner

“You are anaesthetising a patient for an awake craniotomy.

Can you start by outlining the indications for an awake craniotomy?”

Candidate

“Awake craniotomy is primarily indicated for surgery involving eloquent cortex, where intraoperative functional mapping is required to maximise lesion resection while minimising postoperative neurological deficit.

The commonest indication is resection of brain tumours adjacent to speech and language areas in the dominant hemisphere, such as Broca’s or Wernicke’s areas. It is also indicated for lesions near the motor or sensory cortex requiring cortical mapping, epilepsy surgery where seizure foci are close to functional cortex, and for deep brain stimulation surgery where clinical testing is required.

Less commonly, it may be used for vascular lesions such as arteriovenous malformations or mycotic aneurysms near critical brain regions.

The advantages are increased extent of resection, potential survival benefit in tumour surgery, reduced neurological morbidity, shorter hospital stay, and reduced postoperative nausea and vomiting.”

Examiner

“What anaesthetic techniques are available? In particular, talk me through asleep–awake–asleep versus awake throughout, and why you might choose one over the other. Please include the drugs you would use.”

Candidate

“There is no single gold-standard technique, and the approach depends on patient factors, pathology, surgeon preference, and anticipated duration of surgery.

Broadly, there are three approaches: sedation only — often termed ‘awake throughout’; general anaesthesia with awakening for mapping; and general anaesthesia with awake mapping followed by re-anaesthetising for closure — the asleep–awake–asleep technique.

In the ‘awake throughout’ technique, the patient receives titrated sedation while maintaining spontaneous ventilation without an airway device. Sedation is deepened for the stimulating parts of surgery such as Mayfield pin insertion, skin incision, craniotomy and dural opening. Sedation is then reduced or stopped completely for cortical mapping and neurocognitive testing. It can be increased again for closure.

The advantages of this technique are avoidance of airway instrumentation and its associated risks, and potentially lower rates of nausea and vomiting. However, it requires careful titration. Excessive sedation risks airway obstruction, hypoventilation, hypercapnia and raised intracranial pressure. Inadequate sedation leads to anxiety and poor tolerance.

Commonly used drugs in the UK are propofol and remifentanil via target-controlled infusions. Short-acting agents are preferred to allow rapid neurological assessment. Dexmedetomidine is increasingly used; it provides sedation, anxiolysis and analgesia without respiratory depression, and patients remain easily rousable. However, it can cause dose-dependent bradycardia and hypotension.

The asleep–awake–asleep technique involves induction of general anaesthesia, airway control — commonly with a supraglottic airway device, though intubation may be used — and controlled ventilation. Anaesthetic agents are then discontinued for mapping, the airway device removed once safe, and the patient awakened for testing. After tumour resection, general anaesthesia may be reintroduced for closure.

The advantages here are secure airway control during the most stimulating phases and the ability to control carbon dioxide, avoiding hypercapnia and brain swelling. It also allows greater depth of anaesthesia for pinning and craniotomy. The disadvantages are the need for smooth transitions and potential airway difficulty once the head is fixed in pins.

Drug choices are similar — propofol and remifentanil are most common, sometimes volatile agents with remifentanil. Depth of anaesthesia monitoring may be used to reduce drug consumption and facilitate timely wake-up.

Irrespective of technique, a bilateral scalp block is fundamental. Sedation or general anaesthesia alone is insufficient for analgesia. The scalp block reduces haemodynamic responses and improves patient tolerance.

The scalp block targets seven nerves bilaterally: supraorbital, supratrochlear, zygomaticotemporal and auriculotemporal branches of the trigeminal nerve, and the greater and lesser occipital and greater auricular nerves from cervical roots. Long-acting local anaesthetics such as bupivacaine, levobupivacaine or ropivacaine are used, often with adrenaline to prolong duration and reduce bleeding. Total dose must be calculated carefully to avoid toxicity.

The brain parenchyma itself is not pain-sensitive; pain arises from scalp, muscle, dura and pin sites.”

Examiner

“What are the contraindications?”

Candidate

“Contraindications can be divided into absolute and relative.

Absolute contraindications include patient refusal, inability to cooperate, confusion, and inability to lie still for any length of time.

Relative contraindications include severe anxiety, language barriers that would impair mapping, learning difficulties, inability to lie flat, obstructive sleep apnoea with risk of airway obstruction, significant cough, and young age.

Careful preoperative selection is critical. The patient must understand the procedure and what is expected of them. Preoperative assessment by the multidisciplinary team, including neurosurgeon, anaesthetist and often neuropsychologist, is essential to establish rapport and assess suitability.”

Examiner

“What problems might you encounter during surgery? Let’s focus particularly on pain and seizures.”

Candidate

“Intraoperative problems can be considered under airway and respiratory, cardiovascular, anaesthetic technique-related, surgical and psychological categories.

Focusing first on pain: inadequate scalp block or insufficient local infiltration may result in pain during pinning or incision. Dural manipulation can also cause discomfort. Management involves prompt supplementation of local anaesthetic by the surgeon, titration of short-acting opioids such as remifentanil, and reassurance. Positioning discomfort is also common due to prolonged immobility.

Nausea and vomiting must be prevented because they can increase intracranial pressure. Prophylactic anti-emetics such as ondansetron, cyclizine and dexamethasone are routinely used.

Seizures are most likely during cortical stimulation. They are usually focal but may generalise. First-line management is irrigation of the cortex with ice-cold saline, which is often sufficient. If seizures persist, benzodiazepines or additional anti-epileptic drugs may be required. If control is not achieved, re-sedation and airway control with conversion to general anaesthesia may be necessary.

Airway compromise is always a concern, particularly during sedation. Hypoventilation, obstruction and hypercapnia can occur, leading to a ‘tight’ brain. An emergency airway plan must be in place at all times. Insertion of a supraglottic airway is often easier than intubation with the head fixed in pins.

Other potential issues include hypotension or hypertension, bradycardia, local anaesthetic toxicity, venous air embolism — particularly in the sitting position — brain swelling, and patient intolerance or agitation.

Overall, awake craniotomy is generally well tolerated, but its success depends on meticulous patient selection, effective scalp analgesia, careful titration of short-acting agents, and clear communication within the multidisciplinary team.”

## Science Question - Physiology

Examiner

“Let’s move on to physiology.

Can you talk to me about cerebral blood flow in traumatic brain injury?”

Candidate

“Yes.

I’ll structure my answer under four headings:
First, normal cerebral blood flow and its control.
Second, the Monro–Kellie doctrine.
Third, what happens to autoregulation in traumatic brain injury.
And finally, how this informs our medical management of raised intracranial pressure.”

Examiner

“Start with normal cerebral blood flow.”

Candidate

“In health, cerebral blood flow is approximately 50 mL per 100 g of brain tissue per minute, equating to around 700–750 mL per minute in an adult — roughly 15% of cardiac output.

Cerebral perfusion pressure, or CPP, is defined as mean arterial pressure minus intracranial pressure:

CPP = MAP – ICP.

Normal CPP is usually maintained between 60 and 100 mmHg.

Cerebral blood flow is tightly regulated by autoregulation. In healthy individuals, over a CPP range of approximately 50 to 150 mmHg, cerebral blood flow remains relatively constant. This is achieved by arteriolar vasoconstriction when blood pressure rises, and vasodilation when blood pressure falls.

Outside this range, autoregulation fails and cerebral blood flow becomes pressure-dependent.

In addition to pressure autoregulation, carbon dioxide is a major physiological regulator. CBF changes approximately 2–4% per mmHg change in PaCO₂. Hypercapnia causes cerebral vasodilation and increases CBF and intracranial blood volume. Hypocapnia causes vasoconstriction and reduces CBF.

If I were to draw the graph, it would show a near-linear relationship between PaCO₂ and cerebral blood flow within the physiological range.

Oxygen tension has less influence until PaO₂ falls below about 8 kPa, at which point hypoxia causes cerebral vasodilation and increased CBF.

Metabolic control is also important — increased neuronal activity increases local blood flow via flow–metabolism coupling.”

Examiner

“Now explain the Monro–Kellie doctrine.”

Candidate

“The Monro–Kellie doctrine states that the cranial vault is a fixed volume containing three components: brain tissue, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid.

Because the skull is rigid, the total volume of these three components must remain constant. An increase in one component must be compensated by a decrease in another, otherwise intracranial pressure will rise.

Initially, compensation occurs through displacement of CSF into the spinal compartment and reduction of venous blood volume. However, once these compensatory mechanisms are exhausted, small increases in volume cause large rises in ICP.

In traumatic brain injury, additional volumes such as haematoma, cerebral oedema, or hyperaemia further increase intracranial volume, pushing the patient onto the steep part of the pressure–volume curve.”

Examiner

“So what happens to autoregulation in TBI?”

Candidate

“In traumatic brain injury, autoregulation is frequently impaired or completely lost.

This means cerebral blood flow becomes pressure-passive — it varies directly with mean arterial pressure.

If blood pressure falls, cerebral perfusion falls, increasing the risk of secondary ischaemic injury. Conversely, hypertension may increase cerebral blood volume and worsen intracranial pressure.

Carbon dioxide reactivity may be preserved, partially impaired, or absent depending on injury severity.

Loss of autoregulation makes management more complex, because the brain is more vulnerable both to hypotension and to excessive vasodilation from hypercapnia.

Furthermore, cerebral oedema — whether cytotoxic or vasogenic — increases brain volume and reduces compliance, worsening intracranial hypertension.”

Examiner

“How does this inform your management of raised ICP in TBI?”

Candidate

“Our management aims to prevent secondary brain injury by maintaining adequate cerebral perfusion while minimising intracranial pressure.

The key physiological targets are:

First, maintaining adequate CPP — generally aiming for a CPP of at least 60 mmHg, balancing MAP and ICP.

Second, strict avoidance of hypotension, as even a single episode significantly worsens outcome in TBI due to pressure-passive cerebral circulation.

Third, maintaining normocapnia. Hypercapnia increases cerebral blood volume and ICP. Controlled mild hypocapnia can acutely reduce ICP via vasoconstriction, but prolonged or excessive hyperventilation risks cerebral ischaemia and is therefore used cautiously and temporarily.

Fourth, avoidance of hypoxia, as hypoxia causes vasodilation and increases CBF and ICP.

Medical management of raised ICP includes:

Optimising head position to promote venous drainage.

Sedation and analgesia to reduce cerebral metabolic demand and sympathetic surges.

Osmotherapy with hypertonic saline or mannitol to reduce cerebral oedema.

Controlled ventilation to maintain appropriate PaCO₂.

Maintenance of normothermia and normoglycaemia.

In refractory cases, neuromuscular blockade, barbiturate coma, or decompressive craniectomy may be considered.

Overall, understanding the loss of autoregulation and the fixed intracranial volume described by Monro–Kellie underpins all management decisions. The aim is to maintain oxygen delivery to vulnerable brain tissue while preventing further rises in intracranial pressure.”


# One Lung Ventilation Short Case

## Clinical Question

Question 1 (Clinical): Pleurodesis and one-lung ventilation

Examiner: You’re seeing a 26-year-old coming to theatre for pleurodesis. What anaesthetic considerations would you have?

Candidate: I’d start by clarifying the indication and physiology. In a 26-year-old it’s often recurrent pneumothorax, but it could be recurrent effusion. Either way, I’m anticipating reduced respiratory reserve on the affected side, potential ongoing air leak, and the need for surgical exposure that commonly requires lung isolation and one-lung ventilation. So my considerations group into: pre-op assessment and optimisation, the plan for lung isolation, intra-op ventilation strategy and hypoxaemia management, and post-op analgesia and respiratory care.

Pre-operatively I’d assess baseline respiratory function, oxygen requirement, and symptoms at rest and on minimal exertion. I’d review imaging—particularly the side involved and any airway or bronchial distortion that might influence device choice and placement. I’d check for sepsis if there’s infection or empyema, and for haemodynamic stability, because hypoxaemia during one-lung ventilation is more likely to be tolerated poorly if cardiac output is low. I’d also plan analgesia early because pleurodesis and thoracoscopy are painful and pain will directly impair ventilation post-op.

Intra-operatively, the key is to facilitate pleural access and lung collapse safely, so I’d plan lung isolation with a clear primary technique and a backup plan, including ensuring a fibreoptic bronchoscope is available because it’s essential for confirming position and troubleshooting.

Examiner: So, what options are there for one-lung ventilation?

Candidate: Broadly there are three ways to achieve lung isolation in adults. The commonest is a double-lumen tube, which allows independent ventilation of either lung. The second is a bronchial blocker used with a standard single-lumen tracheal tube to occlude a main bronchus—and some blockers can also enable selective lobar collapse. The third, much less commonly in adults, is advancing a single-lumen tube into a main bronchus to ventilate only one lung, which tends to give slow, incomplete collapse and is generally a rescue option in emergencies or extremely difficult airways.

Examiner: When would you choose a bronchial blocker over a double-lumen tube?

Candidate: I’d choose a bronchial blocker when I want to keep a conventional single-lumen tube in place—most often because the airway is difficult and I want the simplest, most reliable initial intubation, then add lung isolation afterwards. It’s also useful if I anticipate postoperative mechanical ventilation, because with a blocker I can return to two-lung ventilation simply by deflating and withdrawing the blocker rather than exchanging a double-lumen tube. A blocker can also be helpful if I need selective lobar isolation. And in patients with a tracheostomy, blockers are often the practical route—either through the tracheostomy tube or after placing a single-lumen tube via the stoma—because placing a lung isolation device through a tracheostomy is prone to malposition and complete airway loss unless you have a very clear plan.

Examiner: Talk me through how you would insert a double-lumen tube—details please.

Candidate: I’d approach it stepwise and safely.

First, I’d choose the side and size. In most elective thoracic cases I’d use a left-sided double-lumen tube. A right-sided double-lumen tube is specifically indicated if surgery involves the left main bronchus—for example left pneumonectomy or left lung transplant—or if the left main bronchus is distorted, such as compression by tumour or an aneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta, and sometimes for left-sided thoracoscopic surgery depending on surgical preference.

For size, adult tubes are commonly 35, 37, 39 and 41 French. The ideal is a tube that passes easily through the glottis, advances without resistance, and the bronchial limb sits without difficulty in the intended bronchus. If CT measurements of the left main bronchus are available, that’s the most accurate method. Practically, many use around 37 Fr for an average female and 39 Fr for an average male, adjusting up or down with body size, and confirming position with fibreoptic bronchoscopy.

Before insertion I’d check cuff integrity—both tracheal and bronchial cuffs. I’d lubricate the outside of the tube, and insert and lubricate the intubating stylet into the endobronchial lumen, shaping it to aid placement.

Then I’d perform direct laryngoscopy and visualise the cords. I’d advance the tube until the bronchial cuff has passed beyond the vocal cords, then remove the stylet to avoid trauma. Next, I’d rotate the tube 90 degrees—clockwise or anticlockwise depending on whether it’s a right- or left-sided tube—so the bronchial lumen lines up with the target main bronchus. I’d then advance until I feel gentle resistance.

For depth, in an average-sized adult there’s a useful estimate: about 12 + (height in cm / 10) measured at the teeth, but I’d treat that as a guide only and then confirm properly with auscultation and fibreoptic bronchoscopy.

Examiner: How do you confirm the position?

Candidate: I’d do it in two layers: a functional check with clamping and auscultation, then an anatomical check with fibreoptic bronchoscopy.

Functionally, I use a three-step approach. Step one: inflate the tracheal cuff with the minimum volume needed to seal, ventilate and confirm bilateral air entry and a good capnography trace. Step two: clamp the tracheal limb, disconnect it from the tracheal lumen, inflate the bronchial cuff—typically 1 to 3 mL—and ventilate through the bronchial lumen, confirming unilateral ventilation and no significant leak. Step three: release the clamp and re-establish ventilation through both lumens, confirming bilateral air entry again.

Then I confirm with fibreoptic bronchoscopy. For a left-sided tube, I pass the scope via the tracheal lumen to see the carina and identify the blue bronchial cuff sitting as a thin crescent in the left main bronchus without herniating over the carina when inflated. For a right-sided tube, fibreoptic confirmation is essential: in addition to seeing the carina, I pass the scope down the endobronchial lumen and ensure the tube’s side opening—Murphy’s eye—is aligned with the right upper lobe bronchus so I don’t obstruct right upper lobe ventilation.

Examiner: How can you help the surgeons to collapse the operative lung?

Candidate: The basics are: ensure correct device position, then enable passive collapse efficiently. With a double-lumen tube I’d confirm the bronchial cuff seal and then open the non-ventilated lumen to atmosphere to allow deflation, and I can suction the non-ventilated lung via the appropriate lumen if needed. If collapse is still poor, I’d recheck position with fibreoptic bronchoscopy because malposition is the commonest issue, and I’d coordinate with the surgeons—sometimes surgical manipulation or patient positioning can dislodge the tube. If they need temporary re-expansion for checking, I can briefly reinflate the lung and then return to one-lung ventilation.

Examiner: The patient starts desaturating during one-lung ventilation. What do you do?

Candidate: I’d manage it in a structured, sequential way while keeping the patient safe.

First, I’d treat it as an emergency if it’s sudden and severe: I’d immediately increase FiO₂ to 1.0—except in the rare scenario of significant bleomycin exposure where I’d be cautious with high oxygen—and I’d check the circuit, capnography and ventilation pressures.

Next, I’d check the commonest reversible cause: tube or blocker position. Hypoxaemia frequently improves once the lung isolation device is correctly positioned, so I’d go straight to fibreoptic bronchoscopy to confirm the bronchial cuff hasn’t migrated or herniated, and that the ventilated lung isn’t being partially obstructed.

In parallel I’d ensure haemodynamics and cardiac output are adequate—because oxygen delivery depends on flow as well as saturation—so I’d treat hypotension with fluids, vasopressors or inotropes as appropriate.

Then I’d optimise the ventilated lung: I’d consider a recruitment manoeuvre, being mindful it can transiently worsen oxygenation by diverting blood to the non-ventilated lung and can cause hypotension. I’d adjust PEEP to the ventilated lung cautiously—particularly cautious in COPD where excessive PEEP can increase air trapping and worsen V/Q mismatch.

If desaturation persists, I’d apply oxygen to the non-ventilated lung and then add low-level CPAP, typically around 1–5 cmH₂O, to reduce shunt while still allowing surgical access. If even that doesn’t work, intermittent reinflation of the non-ventilated lung can improve oxygenation and may “precondition” the hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction response over repeated exposures, although it interrupts surgery.

As a later step, if surgical access allows, the surgeons can mechanically restrict blood flow to the non-ventilated lung, for example by clamping pulmonary arterial flow, reducing shunt.

And if I have sudden severe desaturation despite these measures, I’d prioritise oxygenation and immediately resume two-lung ventilation until the patient is stable, then reattempt one-lung ventilation once the cause is identified and corrected.

Examiner: Any lung-protective considerations during one-lung ventilation?

Candidate: Yes. Patients requiring one-lung ventilation are at increased risk of perioperative lung injury, and ventilation strategy matters. I’d use a lung-protective approach: keep FiO₂ as low as feasible once oxygenation is stable, use low tidal volumes around 6 mL/kg predicted body weight aiming to keep peak pressures not more than about 35 cmH₂O, add modest PEEP around 5–8 cmH₂O unless COPD physiology makes added PEEP harmful, use recruitment manoeuvres as needed, and accept permissive hypercapnia if necessary to avoid injurious pressures.

## Science Question - Anatomy

Examiner: Describe the pleural cavity.

Candidate: The pleural cavity is a potential space between two layers of serous pleura: the visceral pleura, which tightly invests the lung surface and dips into the fissures, and the parietal pleura, which lines the inside of the thoracic wall, the diaphragm, and the mediastinum. The two layers are continuous at the lung hilum, where structures pass in and out of the lung. Normally the cavity contains only a thin film of pleural fluid, which reduces friction and allows smooth movement during respiration, and the pressure within the pleural space is sub-atmospheric, helping keep the lungs expanded.

The parietal pleura can be described in parts: costal pleura lining the ribs and intercostal spaces; diaphragmatic pleura covering the diaphragm; mediastinal pleura lining the mediastinum; and cervical pleura, which extends into the root of the neck as the pleural cupola.

There are also pleural reflections and recesses. Because the lung doesn’t fully occupy the pleural envelope at all phases of respiration, the pleural cavity forms recesses—most notably the costodiaphragmatic recess inferiorly and the costomediastinal recess anteriorly—where fluid can accumulate.

Clinically, this anatomy matters because air, fluid or blood in the pleural space can compromise ventilation and oxygenation, and because procedures like chest drains aim to enter the pleural cavity without injuring lung, diaphragm or neurovascular structures.

Examiner: Tell me the boundaries of the safe triangle for a chest drain, and where you’d insert the drain.

Candidate: The “safe triangle” is on the lateral chest wall. It’s bounded anteriorly by the lateral edge of pectoralis major, posteriorly by the anterior edge of latissimus dorsi, inferiorly by a horizontal line at about the 5th intercostal space, and superiorly by the base of the axilla. In practice, the usual insertion point is around the 4th or 5th intercostal space, just anterior to the mid-axillary line, within that triangle. I’d dissect over the superior border of the rib to avoid the intercostal neurovascular bundle that runs along the inferior rib margin.

Examiner: What procedures or techniques can damage the pleural cavity?

Candidate: I’d group them into iatrogenic puncture, barotrauma, and surgical injury. Iatrogenic puncture includes chest drain insertion itself, thoracentesis, central venous catheterisation—particularly subclavian approaches—intercostal nerve blocks, pleural biopsies, and pacemaker insertion. Barotrauma from positive pressure ventilation can cause pneumothorax, especially with high airway pressures or underlying bullous disease. Surgical injury includes thoracic surgery, upper abdominal surgery near the diaphragm, and trauma-related procedures. Even vigorous CPR can cause rib fractures and pleural or lung injury.

Examiner: What substances can accumulate in the pleural space?

Candidate: The common ones are air—pneumothorax; blood—haemothorax; pus—empyema; and fluid—pleural effusion, which can be transudate or exudate including malignant effusions. Less commonly, chyle can accumulate—chylothorax—after thoracic duct injury, and in rarer situations you can see other fluids such as urine in a urinothorax. Clinically, identifying what’s in the pleural space guides both the acute management and the underlying diagnosis.

# Mastectomy and free flap surgery Short Case

## Clinical Question

Clinical 3: Mastectomy, axillary clearance and free-flap breast reconstruction post-chemotherapy

Examiner: You’re anaesthetising a patient for mastectomy, axillary node clearance and free-flap breast reconstruction after chemotherapy. Talk me through your approach.

Candidate: I’d structure my approach into four parts: first, pre-operative assessment and selection issues, including chemotherapy effects; second, the intraoperative physiological goals for free-flap perfusion; third, the practical conduct of anaesthesia for a long case—monitoring, ventilation, positioning and temperature; and finally, emergence, analgesia and postoperative flap surveillance.

Pre-operatively, I’d confirm the reconstructive plan—most commonly a DIEP free flap—and whether this is immediate or delayed, as that affects bleeding and transfusion risk. I’d review a recent full blood count: haemoglobin for oxygen carriage, neutrophils for infection risk and antibiotic planning, and platelets for bleeding and the safety of regional techniques. I’d actively assess chemotherapy sequelae: high risk of nausea and vomiting, dehydration and electrolyte disturbance, and I’d plan multimodal antiemetics and optimise hydration.

Access needs planning because veins may be poor post-chemotherapy, and after axillary surgery we generally avoid venepuncture, cannulation and blood pressure cuffs on the operated side. So I’d aim for large-bore peripheral access on the contralateral arm early, and I’d have a low threshold for central venous access if peripheral access is unreliable, because this is long surgery and haemodynamic stability is important.

Examiner: What are the physiological goals of free-flap surgery?

Candidate: The goal is to maintain reliable blood flow through the flap microcirculation and the arterial and venous anastomoses. I’d categorise that into the determinants of flow: perfusion pressure gradient, vessel calibre, and blood viscosity.

First, perfusion pressure gradient—systemic arterial pressure minus venous pressure. I aim for stable perfusion pressure and avoid sustained hypotension. In breast free flap surgery the anastomosis is usually to the internal mammary vessels, which are close to the heart and tend to have good perfusion pressure, so I do not chase supranormal blood pressure targets with fluid.

Second, vessel calibre. Denervated flap tissue loses intrinsic sympathetic tone, but recipient vessels still respond to stimuli such as cold, circulating catecholamines and drugs. Therefore I aim for a warm, vasodilated patient with low systemic vascular resistance and good peripheral perfusion. Practically, that means preventing hypothermia, treating pain, and avoiding hypoxia and extremes of CO₂ that provoke sympathetic activation or vasoconstriction.

Third, blood viscosity. I aim for an appropriate haematocrit, typically around 30–35%, balancing oxygen delivery against viscosity to optimise microvascular flow.

Putting that together, the target physiology is a hyperdynamic circulation—adequate cardiac output with peripheral vasodilation—and avoidance of hypovolaemia, vasoconstriction and hypothermia.

Examiner: How would you manage fluids and blood pressure intraoperatively?

Candidate: I’d use goal-directed fluid therapy to maintain normovolaemia while avoiding interstitial oedema. The free flap lacks intact lymphatic drainage and excess fluid can promote oedema, which compromises gas exchange and flow at the microcirculatory level, and can worsen venous drainage. I’d therefore avoid large, empiric fluid loading.

I’d monitor fluid responsiveness with a stroke volume or cardiac output method where available, for example oesophageal Doppler monitoring, and give small boluses guided by response rather than fixed targets.

If blood pressure support is needed once volume status is appropriate, I would use vasopressors to maintain normotension. Although there has been historical concern, clinical experience and available evidence suggest that phenylephrine and ephedrine used to maintain normotension in an adequately filled patient do not adversely affect outcome. I generally avoid vasodilators as a strategy during microsurgery because of concern about reducing effective perfusion pressure and potential redistribution of flow away from the flap.

During dissection, if controlled hypotension is requested, I would primarily achieve this by adjusting anaesthetic depth—volatile concentration and opioid or remifentanil—rather than adding vasodilators.

Examiner: What monitoring and practical conduct of anaesthesia would you plan?

Candidate: This is prolonged surgery, often 6–10 hours, so I plan robust monitoring and meticulous supportive care. I’d intubate and ventilate. I’d place an arterial line for continuous blood pressure monitoring and blood sampling, a urinary catheter to monitor output, and a core temperature probe. Venous access should be large bore and contralateral to the surgery, and if access is difficult post-chemotherapy I would place central venous access early rather than during a crisis.

For maintenance, I’d use either a volatile-based technique in oxygen-enriched air or TIVA. Volatile anaesthesia is commonly used, and whichever technique is chosen, the priority is haemodynamic stability and a smooth emergence profile. I’d use either remifentanil infusion or intermittent opioid dosing depending on the plan for emergence and postoperative analgesia.

Ventilation-wise, I’d aim for normal oxygenation and normocapnia. Hypoxia causes catecholamine release and vasoconstriction, hypocapnia causes vasoconstriction, and hypercapnia can stimulate sympathetic activity, so I avoid extremes.

Positioning is critical. The patient is supine with arms abducted for access, but I ensure abduction is less than 90 degrees to reduce brachial plexus injury risk, forearms neutral to reduce ulnar nerve injury, and I pad all pressure points. Because the case is long, I recheck padding and limb position, and where feasible I’d ensure joints are moved at the end of the case to reduce postoperative stiffness.

Temperature management is a priority throughout. Large areas are exposed for prolonged periods and anaesthesia lowers the threshold for vasoconstriction. I use forced-air warming—often underbody warming so both chest and abdomen remain accessible—warm IV fluids, humidified gases, and maintain an appropriate theatre temperature.

Examiner: What postoperative flap issues are you concerned about? Specifically, what are the signs of arterial versus venous compromise?

Candidate: The key concern is flap compromise due to impaired perfusion, and early detection is the main determinant of salvage. I’d describe monitoring as clinical assessment supported by Doppler.

Clinically I assess flap colour, capillary refill time, turgor, skin temperature, and bleeding on pinprick. An 8 MHz Doppler signal is often used over a marked perforator point and checked regularly in recovery and on the ward.

If the problem is arterial insufficiency, the flap is typically cool and pale, capillary refill is slow, there is no bleeding on pinprick, and there is loss of the arterial Doppler signal.

If the problem is venous outflow obstruction, the flap is warm, congested and bluish, capillary refill is brisk, pinprick produces rapid dark bleeding, and the venous Doppler signal is lost.

If compromise is suspected, I would immediately optimise the systemic physiology—maintain a warm patient, ensure adequate perfusion pressure and normovolaemia, treat pain, and avoid vasoconstriction—while urgently escalating to the surgical team because definitive management is usually prompt re-exploration to relieve kinking or compression, address thrombosis or revise the anastomosis. Salvage rates are highest when managed early.

Examiner: What are your postoperative priorities, including thrombosis prevention and emergence?

Candidate: Postoperatively I continue the intraoperative principles—warmth, stable perfusion, normovolaemia and good analgesia—because secondary ischaemia and thrombosis risk persist after transfer and reperfusion. For thrombosis prevention, I’d use mechanical prophylaxis such as stockings and intermittent pneumatic compression, and pharmacological prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin in line with the surgical plan, which also supports flap survival.

For emergence, I aim for smooth extubation because coughing and retching increase venous pressure and can reduce flap flow. Techniques include maintaining a low-dose remifentanil infusion to facilitate tube tolerance, considering deep extubation in suitable patients, or exchanging the tracheal tube for a supraglottic airway where appropriate and safe.

Examiner: Finally, tell me your analgesia strategy.

Candidate: I’d structure analgesia by operative sites: the chest and the abdominal donor site. In DIEP reconstruction the flap is insensate and the chest wound is often less painful than the abdomen; the abdominal incision is commonly the dominant pain source.

Systemically, I’d use paracetamol, an NSAID if appropriate, and opioids titrated to effect—often with PCA initially.

Regionally, I’d prioritise analgesia for the abdominal donor site using a transverse abdominis plane block. This can be performed under ultrasound at induction or placed by the surgeons under direct vision, and a catheter can be inserted to allow postoperative local anaesthetic infusion. This reduces opioid requirements for up to 48 hours and therefore improves nausea, mobilisation and respiratory function. I’d ensure the analgesic plan is continued consistently postoperatively to avoid sympathetic surges that could compromise flap perfusion

## Science Question - Anatomy - Chest Wall Blocks

Examiner: Describe the innervation of the chest wall and the course of the intercostal nerves. Which spinal roots are involved?

Candidate: The chest wall is supplied predominantly by the intercostal nerves, which are the anterior rami of T1 to T11, with T12 continuing as the subcostal nerve.

Each thoracic spinal nerve exits the intervertebral foramen and divides into a posterior ramus to the back and an anterior ramus that becomes the intercostal nerve. The intercostal nerve runs around the thoracic wall in the intercostal space in the neurovascular plane, accompanied by the intercostal vessels, and gives off lateral cutaneous branches around the mid-axillary line and anterior cutaneous branches near the parasternal region.

For breast surgery, the most relevant dermatomes are typically T2 to T6, because these supply much of the breast skin. The axilla and medial upper arm are clinically important because they can be involved in mastectomy and axillary surgery, and analgesic techniques often aim to cover this region in addition to the anterolateral chest wall.

Examiner: Describe the main chest wall blocks—ESP, serratus anterior plane and PECS—and what they cover.

Candidate: I’ll answer by (1) where the local anaesthetic is deposited, and (2) which nerves and surgical areas are covered.

First: PECS blocks.
PECS blocks are interfascial plane blocks performed under ultrasound guidance.

PECS I is performed by injecting local anaesthetic between pectoralis major and pectoralis minor. Its main target is the medial and lateral pectoral nerves, so it helps with pain from pectoralis muscle dissection.

PECS II adds a deeper injection between pectoralis minor and serratus anterior, giving wider coverage. In addition to pectoral nerves, it aims to block the lateral branches of the intercostal nerves, and it also covers nerves relevant to axillary surgery including the intercostobrachial and long thoracic nerves. Clinically, PECS II is used to extend analgesia to the lateral breast and axilla.

In terms of technique from the article: the probe is placed below the lateral third of the clavicle in an oblique plane; the first injection is at the level of the third rib between pectoralis major and minor, then the probe is adjusted to visualise the fourth rib and the needle directed to the plane between pectoralis minor and serratus anterior. Suggested volumes are 0.2 ml/kg at the PECS I plane and 0.4 ml/kg at the PECS II plane.

Second: Serratus anterior plane block.
This is designed to provide analgesia to the anterolateral chest wall by blocking the lateral cutaneous branches of the thoracic intercostal nerves, described in the article as T2 to T12. The injection is performed under ultrasound in the mid-axillary line at around the 4th or 5th rib, depositing local anaesthetic deep to latissimus dorsi and superficial to serratus anterior. The suggested volume in the article is 0.2 ml/kg of a long-acting local anaesthetic. This block is particularly useful for lateral breast and chest wall analgesia and can contribute to axillary coverage depending on spread.

Third: Erector spinae plane block.
ESP is another fascial plane technique used for breast surgery, performed posteriorly. Clinically, it aims to provide multi-dermatomal analgesia by spread in the erector spinae fascial plane, and it can cover thoracic wall pain across several segments. In breast surgery practice, it’s one of the regional options alongside paravertebral, PECS and serratus plane blocks, with the more anterior plane blocks—PECS and serratus—often favoured for day-case pathways because they avoid neuraxial sympathetic block.

Examiner: You’re shown an ultrasound image of a serratus anterior plane block. Identify the structures, the plane of injection, ribs, and the thoracodorsal artery.

Candidate: I’d identify structures from superficial to deep, then state the target plane.

On the image, I’d expect to see subcutaneous tissue, then latissimus dorsi, and deeper to that the serratus anterior muscle. Beneath serratus, I would identify the rib as a hyperechoic curved line with posterior acoustic shadowing; deeper still lie the intercostal muscles and pleura, so recognising the rib and the depth is important for safety.

The target plane described for this block in breast surgery is deep to latissimus dorsi and superficial to serratus anterior, in the mid-axillary region at about the 4th or 5th rib. I would confirm correct placement by hydrodissection opening that fascial plane with appropriate spread.

For the thoracodorsal artery, I’d look for a vascular structure in the lateral chest wall region—often near the latissimus/serratus area—confirming with colour Doppler if needed, and I’d plan a needle path that avoids it.

# Meningitis Short Case

## Clinical Question


Examiner: A 27-year-old woman presents with fever, headache and neck stiffness. What are your differentials?

Candidate: With that presentation I’d organise the differentials into infective and non-infective, and I’d prioritise the time-critical ones first. Infective causes include acute meningitis—bacterial or viral—and encephalitis, particularly HSV, especially if there’s altered mental state, seizures or focal neurology. I’d also consider focal intracranial sepsis such as a brain abscess or subdural empyema, and occasionally systemic sepsis with meningism. Non-infective causes include subarachnoid haemorrhage, particularly if the headache is sudden onset or maximal at onset, and I’d keep autoimmune encephalitis in mind if microbiology is negative or the course is atypical. Given fever, headache and neck stiffness, my leading diagnosis is acute meningitis until proven otherwise.

Examiner: What is meningitis?

Candidate: Meningitis is inflammation of the meninges—particularly the pia and arachnoid mater—usually due to infection within the subarachnoid space. In bacterial meningitis, organisms typically invade after a period of high-grade bacteraemia, entering at highly vascular sites like the choroid plexus or leptomeningeal vessels, or via direct extension from adjacent infection such as sinusitis, or through a dural defect. The host inflammatory response drives endothelial activation and leucocyte infiltration; that helps control infection but also contributes to cerebral oedema, raised intracranial pressure and neuronal injury, which is what leads to many of the complications and poor outcomes.

Examiner: Which organisms are most important in adults?

Candidate: In immunocompetent adults with community-acquired meningitis, the most common bacterial cause is Streptococcus pneumoniae, and it’s also associated with the highest mortality. Neisseria meningitidis is the second most common, particularly in younger adults, and can be associated with a rash and meningococcal sepsis. Listeria monocytogenes is an important additional pathogen, especially in older patients and in those with immunocompromise, diabetes, malignancy or alcohol dependency. Haemophilus influenzae is now uncommon because of vaccination. If I’m considering viral meningitis, it tends to be less severe and more slowly progressive; the common viruses are enterovirus and herpes viruses, and in meningitis it’s often HSV-2 rather than HSV-1.

Examiner: What complications are you worried about?

Candidate: I think of them as neurological, systemic and long-term sequelae. Neurologically, patients can develop seizures, focal deficits and cranial nerve palsies, raised intracranial pressure from cerebral oedema, hydrocephalus, and suppurative complications like subdural empyema or brain abscess. Systemically, they can progress to septic shock, coagulopathy and multi-organ failure, particularly with meningococcal disease. And long-term, survivors can be left with cognitive impairment and hearing loss—so even when patients survive, morbidity can be substantial.

Examiner: How would you manage this patient?

Candidate: I’d manage this as a medical emergency and work in parallel: immediate stabilisation and immediate treatment, because delays in antibiotics worsen outcome and treatment should start within an hour.

I’d start with an A–E. For airway, I’d assess consciousness and airway reflexes—if she’s maintaining her airway and protecting it, I’d keep her spontaneously breathing, but I’d have a low threshold to escalate if there’s reduced GCS or seizures. For breathing, I’d give high-flow oxygen, monitor saturations, and obtain a blood gas if there are concerns. For circulation, I’d secure IV access promptly, take blood cultures ideally before antibiotics but I would not delay treatment for cultures, and I’d send bloods including FBC, U&Es, glucose, CRP and coagulation. I’d treat hypotension with fluid and vasopressors as needed. For disability, I’d document GCS, pupils, focal neurology, check capillary glucose, and treat seizures promptly. On exposure, I’d look carefully for a rash, purpura, and any source such as otitis or sinusitis.

Then I’d start empirical therapy immediately. I’d give a third-generation cephalosporin—ceftriaxone or cefotaxime—because of good CSF penetration and activity against pneumococcus and meningococcus. If there’s concern about pneumococcal resistance, I’d add vancomycin, and if she had risk factors for Listeria I’d add amoxicillin. If there’s any suspicion of encephalitis—altered mental state, seizures, focal signs—I’d also start aciclovir. I’d give dexamethasone at the same time as, or just before, the first antibiotic dose, because steroids reduce neurological sequelae and are recommended early; if an organism other than pneumococcus or TB is identified, steroids would be stopped.

For diagnostics, lumbar puncture is central, but only if safe. If she has clinical features suggesting raised intracranial pressure—focal neurological signs, papilloedema, ongoing seizures, or a GCS of 12 or less—I’d arrange urgent brain imaging first, but crucially I would not delay antibiotics for imaging. If she has no features suggesting raised ICP or other contraindications, I’d proceed with LP urgently. The LP would include opening pressure, cell count and differential, protein, paired CSF and serum glucose, Gram stain and culture, and PCR for common bacterial pathogens and viral PCR depending on the syndrome.

Examiner: When would you intubate her?

Candidate: I’d intubate if she cannot protect her airway—so a low GCS, loss of airway reflexes, or recurrent vomiting with aspiration risk; if she has refractory seizures or status epilepticus; if there’s respiratory failure; or if she’s in septic shock requiring escalating vasopressors and I need controlled ventilation and oxygenation. I’d also consider intubation if there’s severe agitation preventing safe imaging or treatment. If I intubate, I’d do it in a controlled way with attention to haemodynamic stability and avoiding secondary brain injury—maintaining oxygenation, normocapnia and adequate perfusion pressure.

## Science Questions - Physiology - Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH)

Examiner: A 54-year-old man is presenting for a lung biopsy. His sodium is 122 and he is confused. What’s the cause of his confusion?

Candidate: The likely cause is symptomatic hyponatraemia causing cerebral oedema. In this context—lung pathology—SIADH is a likely mechanism, especially with small cell lung cancer, where ADH can be secreted inappropriately or ectopically. The low plasma osmolality drives water into brain cells, leading to cerebral swelling and neurological symptoms such as confusion, and at the severe end seizures and coma.

Examiner: What is SIADH, and what causes it?

Candidate: SIADH is inappropriate ADH activity—ADH is released or acts despite low plasma osmolality and without appropriate haemodynamic triggers. That causes water retention at the kidney, leading to dilutional hyponatraemia, low serum osmolality, and urine that remains inappropriately concentrated.

The major causes fall into a few groups: malignancy—especially small cell lung cancer; CNS disorders such as haemorrhage, trauma, infections and tumours; pulmonary disease like pneumonia or respiratory failure; medications such as SSRIs, carbamazepine, and some chemotherapeutic agents; and then perioperative triggers—surgery, pain and stress can all stimulate ADH release. Positive pressure ventilation can also contribute by stimulating baroreceptors and promoting non-osmotic ADH release.

Examiner: Talk me through how sodium and water balance are regulated—what’s the physiology?

Candidate: I’d frame it as three interacting systems: osmoregulation via ADH, volume regulation via the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, and natriuretic peptides.

ADH is released from the posterior pituitary in response to increased plasma osmolality and also in response to non-osmotic triggers like hypovolaemia, pain and stress. In the kidney, ADH binds V2 receptors in the collecting duct, increasing aquaporin-2 channel expression and water reabsorption—so it concentrates urine and dilutes plasma sodium.

RAAS is triggered by reduced renal perfusion pressure, reduced sodium delivery to the macula densa, and sympathetic activation. Renin leads to angiotensin II, which constricts arterioles and stimulates aldosterone release. Aldosterone increases sodium reabsorption in the distal nephron, with water following, supporting circulating volume.

Natriuretic peptides, such as BNP and ANP, promote natriuresis, counteracting RAAS and helping excrete sodium and water in states of volume expansion.

In SIADH, ADH secretion becomes uncoupled from appropriate osmotic and haemodynamic control, so the patient retains free water, plasma becomes hypotonic, and sodium falls, while urine remains inappropriately concentrated.

Examiner: How would you classify hyponatraemia?

Candidate: The most useful classification starts with serum osmolality, then volume status. First, determine if it’s hypotonic hyponatraemia—which is the commonest and clinically important category—or isotonic pseudohyponatraemia, or hypertonic hyponatraemia such as from hyperglycaemia. Once it’s confirmed hypotonic, I classify by volume status into hypovolaemic, euvolaemic or hypervolaemic. SIADH is characteristically a hypotonic, euvolaemic hyponatraemia, with inappropriately concentrated urine and elevated urinary sodium, and normal thyroid, adrenal and renal function.

Examiner: How would you treat SIADH in this patient?

Candidate: I’d treat based on symptoms and risk. He is confused with sodium 122, so he has clinically significant symptoms and needs urgent management.

First, I’d confirm and assess: repeat sodium, measure serum osmolality, urine osmolality and urine sodium, and review volume status clinically to ensure this is SIADH rather than hypovolaemic hyponatraemia such as cerebral salt wasting in a neuro patient. In a lung tumour context, SIADH is more likely.

Treatment begins with addressing the cause and restricting free water—fluid restriction is the cornerstone. Because he’s symptomatic, I would also use hypertonic saline cautiously. The goal is an initial controlled rise—enough to improve symptoms—typically aiming to increase sodium by about 4–6 mmol/L early, while avoiding overcorrection. I’d monitor sodium frequently, every 2–4 hours initially, and set strict correction limits to reduce the risk of osmotic demyelination: generally no more than 10 mmol/L in 24 hours in low-risk patients, and no more than 8 mmol/L in high-risk patients.

If he were less symptomatic, I’d start with fluid restriction and stopping precipitating drugs. If restriction fails, second-line options include oral salt and loop diuretics, and for refractory cases urea or a vasopressin antagonist such as tolvaptan, with careful monitoring. Throughout, I’d avoid hypotonic fluids, and if this were elective surgery I’d consider postponing until sodium is optimised.
